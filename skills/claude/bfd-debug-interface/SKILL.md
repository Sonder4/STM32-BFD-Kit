# BFD Debug Interface

## Self-Improvement Loop (Required)

- When this skill encounters a build, flash, debug, script-usage, or other workflow problem, do not stop at the local workaround after the issue is solved.
- Record the resolved issue and lesson in `BFD-Kit/.learnings/ERRORS.md` and/or `BFD-Kit/.learnings/LEARNINGS.md`; unresolved capability gaps go to `BFD-Kit/.learnings/FEATURE_REQUESTS.md`.
- Promote reusable fixes into the affected BFD-Kit asset in the same task when feasible: update the relevant `SKILL.md`, script, wrapper, or resource so the next run benefits by default.
- When a learning is promoted into a skill or script, append a short entry to `BFD-Kit/.learnings/CHANGELOG.md` and mention the improvement in the task close-out.

## Overview

Use this skill to run standardized STM32 debug sessions with repeatable CLI and GDB commands.

## Required Precheck

Run bootstrap before any debug action:

```bash
python3 ./.codex/skills/bfd-project-init/scripts/bootstrap.py --project-root . --mode check
```

## Log and Evidence Policy (Required)

- Save debug session logs and register snapshots under repository paths.
- Use:
  - `logs/debug/` for session and register logs
  - `logs/hw_error/` for fault records
- Do not keep final artifacts in `/tmp`.
- Fail-fast when `.codex/bfd/active_profile.env` is missing.

## Tool Resolution

| Tool | Rule |
|------|------|
| J-Link | Resolve from `PATH` (`JLinkExe`, `JLinkGDBServerCLExe`) |
| ST-Link | Resolve from `PATH` (`STM32_Programmer_CLI`, `ST-LINK_gdbserver`) |
| SVD Files | Resolve from `STM32_SVD` in bootstrap profile |

RTT note:

- J-Link RTT capture uses the existing `build_tools/jlink/rtt.sh` flow.
- ST-Link-specific debug and memory control should use the independent `bfd-stlink-interface` skill.
- ST-Link RTT capture should use the independent `bfd-strtt-rtt` skill.
- Native HSS remains J-Link-only.

## Service Timeout With Missing Upstream Status

If the host can send a service/action request but never sees the expected upstream status packets, do not jump straight into application FSM debugging:

1. Verify whether `SYSTEM_STATUS`, `ODOM`, and other routine upstream packets have stopped globally, not just the service response.
2. Capture RTT and look for repeated USB warnings such as `W:[usb] tx fail ... status=1`; on STM32 USB CDC this usually means `USBD_BUSY`.
3. If this signature is present, classify the problem as an upstream transport blockage first.
4. For firmware that reuses a shared static TX buffer, confirm the USB path serializes senders and waits for `TxState == 0` both before reusing the buffer and after `CDC_Transmit_*()` succeeds.

This check is often faster than instrumenting the service FSM and prevents misdiagnosing a transport stall as a control-plane logic bug.

## Zephyr USB CDC ACM Fault Triage

If a Zephyr firmware only faults after enabling a service that can select different transports, do not immediately blame missing downstream peripherals such as motors or sensors. Isolate the failing path first:

1. Compare `service disabled`, `service enabled + UART forced`, and `service enabled + USB selected`.
2. If only the USB-selected path faults, treat it as a transport-init problem until disproven.
3. Capture `CFSR`, current `PC`, and the smallest useful readiness globals such as `s_comm_ready`, `g_is_initialized`, `g_usb_ready`, `g_usb_enabled`, and the selected transport pointer.
4. On legacy Zephyr USB CDC ACM stacks, avoid writing `DCD/DSR` line-control signals immediately after `usb_enable()`. Prefer plain `usb_enable()` first, then verify host enumeration and `/dev/ttyACM*` payload separately.

This staged isolation is faster and more reliable than starting from a hardware-absence hypothesis.

## Immediate HardFault Right After Flash/Reset

If a freshly flashed STM32 firmware lands in `HardFault_Handler` before you can reach `main`, do not start with business logic. First verify the image and memory layout that actually reached the chip:

1. Read the live vector table at `0x08000000` and compare the initial MSP / reset vector against the ELF `.isr_vector`.
2. Check the linked `_estack` in the map file against the target's real SRAM topology, not just the copied linker script filename. On STM32F4 migrations, CCM RAM is separate and does not extend the `0x20000000` AHB SRAM window.
3. Inspect the active link flags in generated build files such as `build.ninja` or `CMakeFiles/CMakeConfigureLog.yaml`; a copied toolchain file can still force `-T STM32F427XX_FLASH.ld` even when a correct `STM32F407XX_FLASH.ld` already exists in the repo.
4. Only after the live vector table, `_estack`, and linker-script family all match the target MCU should you continue with runtime HardFault triage.

## FreeRTOS Scheduler HardFault Heuristic

If the decoded fault site lands in FreeRTOS internals such as `vListInsertEnd`, `vListInsert`, or `xTaskIncrementTick`, do not assume the kernel is the root cause. First classify whether the list pointers themselves have already been corrupted:

1. Capture `CFSR/HFSR/BFAR/MMFAR` and the stacked fault PC/LR before reset.
2. If `CFSR` shows `PRECISERR + BFARVALID` and `BFAR` is an obviously invalid application address, treat it as prior memory corruption.
3. Audit recently executed variadic log calls first, especially `%f` passed to RTT/SEGGER logs, or `%d/%x` accidentally fed with addresses/pointers.
4. Prioritize hot task loops, delay/error-report paths, and ISR-adjacent logs; on ARM hard-float ABIs, wrong variadic argument types can silently corrupt scheduler/list state and only explode later inside FreeRTOS.

Use the kernel frame as the symptom location and keep tracing outward until you find the application-side memory stomp.

## Quick Session (5 Steps)

1. Start GDB server.
```bash
JLinkGDBServerCLExe -device "${STM32_DEVICE}" -if "${STM32_IF}" -speed "${STM32_SPEED_KHZ}" -port 2331
# or
ST-LINK_gdbserver -p 61234 -m 1
```

2. Connect GDB.
```bash
arm-none-eabi-gdb "${STM32_ELF}"
(gdb) target remote localhost:2331
# or
(gdb) target remote localhost:61234
```

3. Initialize target.
```gdb
(gdb) monitor reset halt
(gdb) load
```

4. Set critical breakpoints.
```gdb
(gdb) break main
(gdb) break HardFault_Handler
```

5. Run and capture evidence.
```gdb
(gdb) continue
(gdb) backtrace
(gdb) info registers
```

## HardFault Playbook

1. Break at fault entry.
```gdb
(gdb) break HardFault_Handler
(gdb) continue
```

2. Read core and fault status.
```gdb
(gdb) info registers
(gdb) print/x *(uint32_t*)0xE000ED28   CFSR
(gdb) print/x *(uint32_t*)0xE000ED2C   HFSR
(gdb) print/x *(uint32_t*)0xE000ED34   MMFAR
(gdb) print/x *(uint32_t*)0xE000ED38   BFAR
```

3. Decode stack frame.
```gdb
(gdb) x/8x $sp
R0, R1, R2, R3, R12, LR, PC, xPSR
```

4. Save evidence.
- `logs/debug/hardfault_<timestamp>.log`
- `logs/hw_error/<date>/...`

5. Hand off to `bfd-fault-logger`.

## Error Detection and Auto-Trigger

### RTT Keyword Monitor

| Keyword | Severity | Action |
|---------|----------|--------|
| `ERROR` | High | Log and analyze |
| `FATAL` | Critical | Halt and log |
| `HardFault` | Critical | Capture fault state |
| `BusFault` | Critical | Capture fault state |
| `MemManage` | Critical | Capture fault state |
| `UsageFault` | High | Log and analyze |

### Trigger Conditions

1. HardFault breakpoint is hit.
2. CFSR indicates BusFault-related bits.
3. Peripheral status registers expose error flags.
4. RTT stream contains high-risk keywords.

### Minimal Automation Snippet

```gdb
break HardFault_Handler
commands
  silent
  info registers
  print/x *(uint32_t*)0xE000ED28
  print/x *(uint32_t*)0xE000ED2C
  print/x *(uint32_t*)0xE000ED34
  print/x *(uint32_t*)0xE000ED38
  x/8x $sp
  continue
end
```

### Context Fields for `bfd-fault-logger`

```json
{
  "error_type": "HardFault|BusFault|PeripheralError|LogError",
  "timestamp": "<debug timestamp>",
  "registers": {
    "pc": "<program counter>",
    "lr": "<link register>",
    "sp": "<stack pointer>",
    "cfsr": "<fault status>",
    "hfsr": "<hard fault status>",
    "bfar": "<bus fault address>",
    "mmfar": "<memmanage fault address>"
  },
  "stack_trace": "<backtrace output>",
  "rtt_log": "<relevant log lines>",
  "peripheral": "<optional peripheral>"
}
```

## Hard Rules

- Capture evidence before proposing fixes.
- Fault analysis must include core registers, fault registers, and stack context.
- Save session logs under `logs/` subdirectories.
- Use `bfd-rtt-logger` for RTT capture to avoid session conflicts.
- Use `bfd-fault-logger` for structured fault archival.

## Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `scripts/var_monitor.py` | Real-time variable monitoring via RTT |
| `scripts/register_view.py` | Peripheral register viewer |
| `scripts/svd_parser.py` | SVD parser for register definitions |
